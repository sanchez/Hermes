# Hermes
Hermes is a nodejs application designed to convert markdown to pdf (using latex). However the aim of the program is to be easily extended so that users can easily customize it. This is currently done by calling user driven functions or by using the built in handlers

## Currently supported
### Headings
Headings can be easily made using standard markdown hashes (\#)

### Bold
To bold a statement, simply surround the statement with double asterisks (\*\*)

### Italics
To italics a statement, simply surround the statement with single asterisks (\*)
